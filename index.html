          <p id=text>I am very rarely angry and almost never cry. I can be more enthusiastic than happy or sad. In my opinion, it's best to always be discreet. And also - don't jump above your own head. After all, as soon as you start chasing something (thrills, fame, money), how can you not stop. Because of this, you stop appreciating the present and become dissatisfied, trying to get even more. Therefore, I think it foolish to deliberately take risks, deliberately testing fate for strength -
          the time will come, death will certainly find you! I am even calmer about my own popularity: glory is capricious. And I also know for sure that money is needed only in order to help someone. You should not restrain yourself in this! "</p>

          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born November 11, 1974 in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (n√©e Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German and Russian ancestry. His middle name, "Wilhelm", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name "Lenny Williams", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.DiCaprio got the name Leonardo thanks to his mother, since he first moved in her stomach when she looked at paintings by Leonardo da Vinci. When DiCaprio was one year old, his parents divorced, and the son stayed with his mother. DiCaprio lived in Los Angeles neighborhoods such as Eco Park and 1874 Hillharst Avenue while his mother worked several jobs.
          He attended Sidd Elementary School, then entered the Los Angeles Advanced Sciences Center , where he studied for four years. Over the course of a single decade - the 1990s - Leonardo DiCaprio graduated from supporting work in television to a status as one of the most sought-after Hollywood actors under 30. After leading roles in William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet and James Cameron's Titanic, the actor became a phenomenon, spawning legions of websites and an entire industry built around his name.</p>
